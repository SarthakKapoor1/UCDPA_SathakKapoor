Final Project for June Certificate in Introductory Data Analysis by [Sarthak Kapoor](https://github.com/SarthakKapoor1)

## [WORLD HAPPINESS INDEX REPORT](https://worldhappiness.report/) <br>
The data used in this visualization comes from the [Gallup World Poll (GWP)](https://www.gallup.com/analytics/318875/global-research.aspx), which ranks countries based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question is called the Cantril ladder, and asks respondents to think of a ladder, where the best possible life would be a 10, and the worst a 0. They then rate their own lives on that 0 to 10 scale. This is also called ***Ladder Score***. This data is available on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021) <br>
The prupose of the project is to analyse and visualize the Happiness Index based on a few factors, these factors include: <br>
1. ***GDP per capita:*** GDP per capita is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people. It divides the country's gross domestic product by its total population
2. ***Healthy Life Expectancy:*** The estimated extent to which Health (Life Expectancy) contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score. The time series of healthy life expectancy at birth are constructed based on data from the World Health Organization and World Development Indicators.
3. ***Social Support:*** Equal to the national average of the responses to the GWP question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”
4. ***Generosity:*** Equal to the residual of regressing the national average of GWP responses to the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.
5. ***Perceptions of Corruption:*** Perceptions of corruption (Trust) are the average of binary answers to two GWP questions: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?”
6. ***Freedom to make Life Choices:*** Equal to the national average of binary responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?” <br> <br>


The nations are compared to a hypothetical country called ***Dystopia***. Dystopia represents the lowest national averages for each of the six key variables and is, along with residual error, used as a regression benchmark. <br>

After importing a few libraries, I was able to prepare, analyse, and visualize the data, post which was also able to gather good insights. <br>
The project also touches on how Machine Learning could be implemented for the same. <br>
